### Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston-

The  **medv**  variable is the target variable.

### Data description-

The Boston data frame has 506 rows and 14 columns.

This data frame contains the following columns:

**_crim_**: per capita crime rate by town.

**_zn_**: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

_**indus**_: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

_**chas**_: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).

_**nox**_: nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).

_**rm**_: average number of rooms per dwelling.

_**age**_: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.

_**dis**_: weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.

_**rad**_: index of accessibility to radial highways.

_**tax**_: full-value property-tax rate per  $10,000.

_**ptratio**_: pupil-teacher ratio by town.

_**black**_: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.

_**lstat**_: lower status of the population (percent).

_**medv**_: median value of owner-occupied homes in  $1000s.

# Import Libraries  
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import seaborn as sns  
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

```
# load dataset  
dataset = pd.read_csv('Boston House Dataset.csv')  
# dropping ALL duplicate values  
dataset.drop_duplicates(keep=False, inplace=True)
```

```
# Correlations Matrix (Visualize Relations between Data)  
correlations = dataset.corr()

# Getting feature (x) and label(y)  
x = dataset.iloc[:, 4:-1].values  
y = dataset.iloc[:, 14].values  
  
# Splitting into Training and Testing dataset  
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)  
  
print(type(x_train), x_train.shape)  
print(type(y_train), y_train.shape)
```

**Output-**

**Model Fitting-**

```
# Model Fit  
reg = LinearRegression()  
reg = reg.fit(x_train, y_train)  
  
Y_pred = reg.predict(x_test)  
  
r2_score = reg.score(x, y)  
print("r2_score:", r2_score)
