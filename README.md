# Machine Learning
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

## Features of Machine Learning-
**1.** It uses the data to detect patterns in a dataset and adjust program actions accordingly.
**2.** It focuses on the developement of computer program that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data.
**3.** It enables computers to find hidden insights using iterative alogrith without being explicitly programmed.
**4.** Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

## Some machine learning methods
Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.

1. **Supervised machine learning** algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.

2. **Unsupervised machine learning** algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesn’t figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.

3. **Semi-supervised machine learning** algorithms fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning, since they use both labeled and unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The systems that use this method are able to considerably improve learning accuracy. Usually, semi-supervised learning is chosen when the acquired labeled data requires skilled and relevant resources in order to train it / learn from it. Otherwise, acquiringunlabeled data generally doesn’t require additional resources.

4. **Reinforcement machine learning** algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. This method allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context in order to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn which action is best; this is known as the reinforcement signal.

It learns from given data and find insights. According to data it makes changes in program.

## Examples

 1. Google Maps: Find your historical patterns etc.
 2. Uber: Find location, find your patterns etc.
 3. Social Media (Tagging): Facebook dface project for tagging people on image.
 4. Virtual Assistant: Google Assistant, Alexa, Cortana etc
 5. Product Recommendations: Amazon
 6. Self Driving Car: Tesla
 7. **Applications using ML**: Netfilx, Amazon, Hulu etc.
  
## Machine Learning Life Cycle
